# Project Summary

This project is geared towards helping you improve your React skills. We will provided minimal guidance compared to most afternoon projects that offer detailed instructions. Therefore, this project can be used as a good check if you are truly understanding and implementing React on your own. When you first go through these set of problems, you may need to look at solutions for help. The goal, however, should be to get to the point where you can complete all sets of problems without any help from solutions and/or mentors.

The solutions provided in this project are just one way you can accomplish the project. If you are curious if your solution is "correct", you can ask a mentor to compare your answer to the ones we are providing.

## Challenge

Once you get to the point where you no longer have to look at the solutions and/or ask mentors for help, time yourself to see how long it takes you to complete all of these sets. After your first time, try to beat that time at least twice. The project is called React Drills for a reason! Repetition will help solidify these React concepts.

Good Luck!

## Setup

To help speed up the process of moving from question to question we have provided a bunch of `app-#/` folders that have been created using the `create-react-app` CLI. Therefore, if you are currently on question 1, you will put your work inside of `app-1`. If you are currently on question 4, you will put your work inside of `app-4`.

- Run `npm install` in each `app-#/` folder before starting the questions.
  - You can either run `npm install` for each `app-#/` before starting question one or just remember to run `npm install` as you move from question to question.

You can then test your work for each question, as you develope a solution, by running `npm run start`.

### App #1

Create a basic react app where you type in a text box and it shows up as text on the DOM.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> app-1/src/App.js </code> </summary>

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";

class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      message: ""
    };
  }

  handleChange(value) {
    this.setState({ message: value });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <input onChange={e => this.handleChange(e.target.value)} type="text" />
        <p>{this.state.message}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

### App #2

Create an app where there is an array of data on state that is then shown on the DOM as a list. The array of data can be as simple as an array of strings. The list can be as simple as a list of `<h2>` elements.

### Solution

<summary> <code> app-2/src/App.js </code> </summary>

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";

class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      foods: ["spaghetti", "ice cream", "sushi", "bologna", "cheese"]
    };
  }

  render() {
    let foodsToDisplay = this.state.foods.map((element, index) => {
      return <h2 key={index}>{element}</h2>;
    });

    return <div className="App">{foodsToDisplay}</div>;
  }
}

export default App;
```

### App #3

Create an app where there is an array of data on state that is then shown on the DOM as a list. There should also be a way for the user to filter what's shown in the list. The array of data can be as simple as an array of strings. The list can be as simple as a list of `<h2>` elements.

### Solution

<summary> <code> app-3/src/App.js </code> </summary>

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";

class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      filterString: "",
      foods: ["spaghetti", "ice cream", "sushi", "bologna", "cheese"]
    };
  }

  handleChange(filter) {
    this.setState({ filterString: filter });
  }

  render() {
    let foodsToDisplay = this.state.foods
      .filter((element, index) => {
        return element.includes(this.state.filterString);
      })
      .map((element, index) => {
        return <h2 key={index}>{element}</h2>;
      });

    return (
      <div className="App">
        <input onChange={e => this.handleChange(e.target.value)} type="text" />
        {foodsToDisplay}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

### App #4

Create a `Login` component that has two text inputs, one for a `username` and one for a `password`, and a button to login the user. When the login button is clicked, an alert should be showed to the user that displays what the user typed in for the `username` and `password`.

### Solution

<summary><code> app-4/src/App.js </code></summary>

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";

import Login from "./Login";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Login />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><code> app-4/src/Login.js </code></summary>

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Login extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      username: "",
      password: ""
    };

    this.handleLogin = this.handleLogin.bind(this);
  }

  handleUsernameChange(name) {
    this.setState({ username: name });
  }

  handlePasswordChange(pass) {
    this.setState({ password: pass });
  }

  handleLogin() {
    alert(`Username: ${this.state.username} Password: ${this.state.password}`);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          onChange={e => this.handleUsernameChange(e.target.value)}
          type="text"
        />
        <input
          onChange={e => this.handlePasswordChange(e.target.value)}
          type="text"
        />
        <button onClick={this.handleLogin}>Login</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Login;
```

### App #5

Create an `Image` component that renders an `<img />` element. The `src` for the `<img />` should be passed down as a prop from the parent component. You can use whatever image URL you would like to or you can get a placeholder from <a href="https://placeholder.com/">Click Me!</a>

### Solution

import Image from "./Image";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Image myImage={"https://http.cat/409"} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react';

export default class Image extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <img src={props.myImage} alt="" />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### App #6

Create an app that displays a to-do list. You will need two components, the `App` component and a `Todo` component. The `App` component should be responsible for getting new tasks and storing the list of tasks. The `Todo` component should be responsible for displaying the individual tasks from the `App` component. The `App` component should create a list of 'Todo' components passing down a `task` into the `Todo` component as a prop and display the list.

### Solution

<details>

<summary><code> app-6/src/App.js </code></summary>

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./App.css";
import Todo from "./Todo";

class App extends Component {
  this.state = {
    list: [],
    input: ""
  };

  handleInputChange(value) {
    this.setState({ input: value });
  }

  handleAddTask() {
    this.setState({
      list: [...this.state.list, this.state.input],
      input: ""
    });
  }

  render() {
    let list = this.state.list.map((element, index) => {
      return <Todo key={index} task={element} />;
    });

    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>My to-do list:</h1>

        <div>
          <input
            value={this.state.input}
            placeholder="Enter new task"
            onChange={e => this.handleInputChange(e.target.value)}
          />

          <button onClick={this.handleAddTask}>Add</button>
        </div>

        <br />

        {list}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><code> app-6/src/Todo.js </code></summary>

```js
import React from "react";

export default function Todo(props) {
  return <p>{props.task}</p>;
}
```
